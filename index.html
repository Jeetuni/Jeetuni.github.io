    <p class="Center">Hi, My name is Jeet Amin. I am currently in my sophomore year of high
      school, attempting to <span class="italics">truly</span> learn computer
      programming.<br> You see, in ninth grade, I took a Computer Science class, but
      I learned absolutely nothing. It unfortuntely took me one year
      to realize<br> I needed to take things into my own hands, for the most part.
      (My buddy Joshua has been holding my hand along the way.
      Here's a<br> link to his superior website: <a href="http://joshuainman.io" target="_blank">joshuainman.io</a>)

    <p class="Center">I didn't know what to do with the meat of this homepage,<br> but my friend
      Kelvin gave me the idea of including pictures of my life,<br> with a caption of what is
      happening in it. <span class="italics"><b>-October 8th, 2017</b></span>
