    <p id="Center">Hi, My name is Jeet Amin. I am currently in my sophomore year of high
      school, attempting to <span class="italics">truly</span> learn computer
      programming.<br> You see, in ninth grade, I took a Computer Science class, but
    I learned absolutely nothing. It unfortuntely took me one year
    to realize<br> I needed to take things into my own hands, for the most part.
  (My buddy Joshua has been holding my hand along the way.
  Here's a<br> link to his superior website: <a href="http:joshuainman.io" target="_blank">joshuainman.io</a>)
